# DSCI-1302-Using-Python-Libraries-
This repository included all of my work I did in my Pricnciples of Programming for Data Science-II (DSCI 1302). It includes data cleaning, orgaining, and alanyzing large 
sets of data using Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, MathplotLib, and Statistcs. 
Some of the homeworks and assignments includes muliple tasks like Data Cleaning and organiging data into readable format and skimming through the data sets then filtering 
the ones required and then plotting the graphs and analyzing them. 
Each file in this repository has a description with the task done in that file for easier navigation
